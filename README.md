# O mnie
Hi, I am Rafał, You can call me Raf.
I have graduated from high school with a mathematical-IT profile. Later my education became little complicated, but who knows what you want to do in life at such young age, right? 
Overall I have graduated from 1st degree studies in managemenet, 2nd degree studies in finance and accounting and finally postgraduate studies in controlling.
For last several years I have been running my own business and by occasion I have helped our family company.
Becouse of my growing interest in IT and my main hobby, which is gaming, I have decided to challenge myself and follow my field of interest.
On this page I will try to collect experience on my way to become a Tester.
